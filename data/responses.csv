8/6/2018 12:35:07,8,9,9,Yes,"Visual interpretation of the graphs, example illustrating how more information could lead to more uncertainty","Pre-meeting access to the files would be nice, but it still worked well as it was"
8/6/2018 13:37:16,5,3,4,Maybe,Presenter in direct contact with audience. Many questions possible. First part (Neil) was well presented. Second part (Robin) seemed very rushed and frantic.,Better structure the order of the material. Not sure if R Markdown is necessary to present the material. If people are not familiar with Rmd it could be very distracting. As it does not add value to the material on InfTheo I would just show/execute the code in R. 
8/7/2018 3:26:31,9,9,9,Yes,"Solid theory behind the topic, combined with putting things in practice. really nice!",perhaps by adding extra examples in the R markdown files and walk them through
8/7/2018 8:16:13,8,8,8,Yes,The speakers were knowledgeable and quite good at explaining the concepts around information theory. The 'hands on' component was good. It was very helpful to have an example to follow through and look back on (i.e. the spinach downy mildew example). There is only so much that can be accomplished in four hours but it certainly got me to start thinking about some applications of Information Theory. Was a bit of a shock stepping out into the middle of the Puerto Rican parade after four hours of statistics:),"My only suggestion would be to have the material posted a little earlier, but we're all busy and it all worked out.
